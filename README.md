# ExpRobLab_FirstAssignment
### A ROS-based exercise for the Experimental Robotics Laboratory course held at the University of Genoa.
Author: Samuele Depalo

## Introduction
This repository contains ROS-based software for controlling a robot. The main component is a state-machine that represent the robot behaviour according to the environment and to some stimulus.
### Scenario
The considered mobile robot retrieves envionment related information from an ontology and uses this data for moving across locations. 
Here how the robot should behave:
1. The robot should move between corridors
2. If a room is not visited for a given time, the robot should visit it
3. If the robot's battery is low on energy, the robot should stop the current action and go in a specific room for recharging
